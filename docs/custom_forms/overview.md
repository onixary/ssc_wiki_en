# Overview

Please first check the relevant examples in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/onixary/shape-shifter-curse-fabric/tree/master/custom_form_pack_example)

Starting from version 1.0.71, the custom form system of this mod has been further improved.
Now you can achieve complete customization of **form models**, **form abilities**, and **action animations** through **datapacks** + **resource packs**

If you have added custom forms in older versions before, you should be able to easily upgrade them to the new version by referring to the content of this chapter

---

**What you can do with resource packs/datapacks:**

- Add brand new custom forms, specifying form types (phase-changing forms/special forms) and body types (humanoid/feral)

- Implement transformation to custom forms under specific conditions through origins_power_extra

- Apply different state animations to custom forms

- Customize models for new forms or override models of existing forms, including soft bone effects

- Customize various abilities (powers) for new forms or override abilities of existing forms

- Customize descriptions of certain forms in the Shape Shifter's Book through localization files


**Some limitations of the current custom form system:**

- Cannot yet add transformation effects from vanilla forms to custom forms

- Cannot yet add form potions for custom forms

- Cannot yet add special mobs that grant transformation effects for custom forms
