# Cursed Moon Event

The `Cursed Moon Event` may periodically trigger during nighttime hours. This is a global event affecting all players.  

For versions 1.0.5 and above, the triggering mechanism uses conditional probability with an expected occurrence every 3 in-game days. Due to probability fluctuations, the actual timing may vary.  

The `Cursed Moon Event` lasts throughout the entire night and causes the following effects:  
- Mobs drop `Untreated Moondust`  
- When in `Initial Form`: Your form will randomly change to stage 1 of a `Progressive Form`, reverting when the event ends  
- When in stages 1 or 2 of a `Progressive Form`: Your form will temporarily advance one stage, reverting when the event ends  
- When in stage 3 of a `Progressive Form`: Your form will temporarily revert to stage 1 of that form, reverting when the event ends. This provides an opportunity to use `Inhibitors` for recovery.
