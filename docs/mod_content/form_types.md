# Form Types

The forms you can transform into are categorized as Progressive Forms, Special Forms, and Permanent Forms.

# Progressive Forms

`Progressive Forms` feature multiple progressive stages. For these forms, as your `Instinct Value` accumulates, your form will advance to the next stage.  

Compared to earlier stages, later stages exhibit more pronounced advantages and disadvantages, creating more significant changes to gameplay experience.

Your form will be affected by `Cursed Moon Events` when in a Progressive Form.

Most forms in the mod belong to this category.

### Instinct System

The `Instinct System` progress bar appears in the center of the screen, just below the experience bar. It indicates your current `Instinct Value` level.  

`Instinct Value` increases slowly over time. Additionally, each form has corresponding `Instinct Behaviors` that trigger rapid increases in instinct when performed.  

When `Instinct Value` reaches maximum, your form will advance to the next stage.

### Progressive Forms List

- Familiar Fox Form stages 1, 2, and 3

# Special Forms

`Special Forms` have no progressive stages. They are not affected by the `Cursed Moon Event`.  

While in a `Special Form`, you can use an `Inhibitor` at any time to revert to your initial form.

### Special Forms List  
- Allay Form

# Permanent Forms

`Permanent Forms` represent the final stages of certain `Progressive Forms`.  

For eligible `Progressive Forms`, use a `Echo Catalyst` at stage 3 to transform into the corresponding permanent form.

**Important Warning: Once transformed into a Permanent Form, there are no in-game mechanics to revert this change. Proceed with caution!**

!!! note  
    Q: I regret my decision! Are there really no other solutions?  
    A: Yes, there are options! With administrator permissions, you can use the command:  
    `/shape-shifter-curse transform_to_form` to set your form.  
    Alternatively, you can delete your character data file located at:  
    `<world_name>\data\shape-shifter-curse` (file named with your UUID) to restore your form to the state before enabling mod content.

### Permanent Forms List  
- Ocelot Form stage 4
