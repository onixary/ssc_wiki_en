# Form-Specific Tools and Trinkets

After version 1.8.1, the mod adds various form-specific tools and trinkets. They can significantly enhance or alter the abilities of the current form, thereby enriching the gameplay experience.

Trinkets mod is required for trinkets.

## Moondust Crystal Grit and Moondust Crystal

To craft these exclusive tools and trinkets, the newly added advanced material `Moondust Crystal` is indispensable.

To obtain `Moondust Crystal`, you first need to craft the placeable block item `Moondust Crystal Grit` using `Untreated Moondust`, `Nether Quartz`, and `Ghast Tear`.

Smelting `Moondust Crystal Grit` in a furnace or blast furnace will yield `Moondust Crystal`.
