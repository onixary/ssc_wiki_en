# Brief Introduction

This mod allows players to gradually transform into different forms based on vanilla Minecraft creature designs, under the influence of the "Cursed Moon" and "Instinct" mechanics, while gaining their unique abilities and disadvantages.

Each form features its own distinct model and (where applicable) special animations. The abilities and disadvantages are carefully designed and balanced to add interesting characteristics while respecting the original game experience.
