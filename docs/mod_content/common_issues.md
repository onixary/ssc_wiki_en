### FAQ:

**My character skin got replaced?**  
After enabling the mod content, the player's character skin will be replaced by the mod's built-in character skin (aka. the shifter). This is done to maintain artistic consistency for the form models and respect the original character designs of other players.

You can retain your own skin by using the in-game command: `/shape-shifter-curse keep_original_skin true`

**Does it work on multiplayer servers?**  
Yes!  
After version 1.0.5, the mod has achieved full server compatibility. If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue report.

**I don't like the firstPerson visual effect**  
After version 1.0.62, form models can display correctly without FirstPerson mod(though we still recommend FirstPerson mod for enhanced immersion).

**Can I create custom forms?**  
Yes. While there are some limitations, you can customize your own forms using data packs combined with resource packs. This includes custom models, unique abilities, instinct system modifications, and descriptive text.  

Please refer to the wiki documentation and examples in the source code repository.

**How do I transform into other forms?**  
During the mod's progression system, you can obtain transformation clues through the achievement system and crafting recipes.  
If you still have questions after this, please consult the wiki documentation.

**Are any forms permanent?**  
Several permanently retained forms were added starting from version 1.0.4.  
Please refer to the mod documentation for specific details.

**I accidentally lost the Book of Shape Shifter**  
You can craft a new one using Untreated Moondust + Book.

**Is this mod SFW?**  
Absolutely!
