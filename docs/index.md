**Shape Shifter Curse** is a Minecraft Java Edition mod developed for the Fabric loader.  

This mod allows players to gradually transform into different forms based on vanilla creatures under the influence of the "Cursed Moon" and "Instincts" mechanics, gaining their unique abilities and drawbacks.  

Each form features independent models and (potential) special animations, with carefully designed and balanced abilities and disadvantages to add engaging features while respecting the original game experience.

Visit the Modrinth and CurseForge pages for more information.

This mod is open-source and free. You can find the [GitHub project here](https://github.com/onixary/shape-shifter-curse-fabric).

!!! note

    As this is a side project with limited development time, future updates will focus on adding more content to the current version (1.20.1) rather than prioritizing adaptation to newer versions.  
    Don't worry—if future game versions introduce interesting new creatures that could inspire additional forms, new transformations can still be added to the mod through brewing mechanics.
